To install the self announcing netprobe using puppet, add the netprobe rpm found in
the files directory into your yum repository first so that it is available using yum. 
Then import the netprobe.pp file into your site.pp or copy the class declaration into 
the appropriate node definition. 

You should know the Gateway, Gateway Port, and Netprobe Ports to use this, as well as any
other attributes you want to track. 

Each instance of the netprobe class creates a separate service and xml file. This will
allow you to create multiple netprobes to run on your servers and you can customize each
to suit the environment or node. The naming scheme makes it easy to identify what port 
each probe is using and what attributes are set for it. 

e.g. /etc/init.d/netprobe_7040 will use netprobe_setup_7040.xml

You'll need to adjust the variables in the init.pp to fit your environment. I left examples
that should be easy to adjust. Puppet uses facts that all servers with a puppet agent 
should be aware of and the other variables in local scope are custom. 

Depending on how you have your nodes defined, you should be able to let puppet do the 
rest for you. Enjoy!
